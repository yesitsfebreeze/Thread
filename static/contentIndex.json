The result is always strange, unpredictable, and somehow useful, though never in ways the sane would choose.\nThe Dreg seeps up from beneath Droskow. Along the canals and mudflats, the earth swells and bubbles with trapped gases. Small pops pass unnoticed, but sometimes a great blister bursts. Its echo carries through the crooked streets, and with it comes a cloud of spores.

The Canals, once crowded with barges and cargo, lie as sticky trenches of drifting sludge. From these puddles the first breath of the Dreg escaped. A bubble swelled in the heart of the city — larger than any before — and after a long, uneasy week, it burst. Life changed, and so did the city. Trade is dead, but somehow, no one starves.

Starts at 3.\nAgenda: A hidden prompt, written by other players.\nItems: Empty slots for special powers gained in play.\n\nRoll once on the Item-Table at the beginning to start with on of them.\n\n\n\n\nAgendas\nAt the start of play:\n\nEach player secretly writes one sentence of something they want to see in the story (a goal, twist, image, theme).\nFold and shuffle the papers, then redistribute so no one gets their own.\nThis becomes your hidden Agenda.\n\nWhen you archive your agenda, you unlock an additional Item-Slot.\nThe maximum items you can carry is limited to 6 by default.\nAgendas are archived when you fulfilled the main task it outlines.\nThis can be tricky to judge sometimes, depending on the way it is written. If there is doubt and you think you finished it, reveal it to the table and state what you archived. If the table disagrees, they now know your agenda, but you still have to complete it.\nAt the end of play, the group selects one Agenda to upload as the legacy outcome for future games.\n\nTaking Actions\nPlayers narrate freely until someone calls an action risky.\nThe table agrees on:\n\nDifficulty (1 = low, 2 = medium, 3 = high).\nRelevant Stat (Body, Mind, or Soul).\n\nRoll 3D6:\n\nLow difficulty → sum all 3 dice + stat.\nMedium difficulty → sum the highest 2 dice + stat.\nHigh difficulty → sum the lowest 2 dice + stat.\n\nResults:\n\n&lt; 9 → fail. Another player narrates the outcome. You take Stress = difficulty.\n= 9 → success with complication. You narrate; another player adds a twist. Take Stress = difficulty.\n&gt; 9 → success. You narrate freely.\n\n\nStress &amp; Collapse\n\nTrack stress with tokens.\nWhen your stress equals your composure, you collapse.\nYour character is temporarily out of play.\n\n\nEncounters\nWhen you collapse:\n\nYou take over an Encounter (NPC, faction, or world event).\nRoll on the Encounter Table to see what enters play.\nEncounters run on the stress tokens you built up — play them until those tokens are cleared.\n\nEncounters also drop Items:\n\nEach time an encounter ends, roll once on the Item-Table.\nThe encounter will then drop this item.\nOne player may pick it up if desired.\nIf their slots are full, they must discard another to put it in their inventory.\n\nCollapse &amp; Return\n\n\nWhen you collapse, your character is out of play and you take over an Encounter.\n\n\nThe Encounter begins with Stress tokens equal to the Stress you had built up.\n\n\nEach action the Encounter takes reduces its Stress pool by 1.\n\n\nWhen the Encounter’s Stress reaches 0, it is resolved, and your character returns to play at 0 Stress.\n\n\nIf the party flees or abandons the Encounter, the player decides whether to:\n\nReturn with them, treating the Encounter as failed, or\nStay with the Encounter, and try to engage/follow the players, until its Stress is spent.\n\n\n\n\nItems\nItems are items gained through encounters.\n\nEach item grants +1 to +3 to a specific stat roll.\nIf you don’t meet the required stat level, using it costs +1 Stress.\nItems last until the end of the play when its not used up.\n\nThey are rolled from a 3 Level Item-Table.\n\n\nUses\nHow many times it can be used before it breaks.\n\n\nobjects\n**What shape the item takes in the story (item, memory, ability, etc.).\n\n\nBonus &amp; Requirement\nWhich stat it boosts, and what minimum stat is required to use it without stress.\n\n\n\nEnd Condition\nPlay continues until all players are collapsed at the same time.\nAt that point, the group decides:\n\nEnd the crawl: record one Agenda as the legacy and upload it to the vault.\nContinue: keep playing as Encounters, spiraling deeper into the story.\n\n\nThe Loop\n\nNarrate → risk → roll.\nMiss/complication → gain stress.\nStress fills → collapse.\nCollapse → encounter.\nEncounter resolves → items gained.\nRepeat until all collapse → end or continue.\n\n\nDesign Principles\n\nMisses = escalation. Failures aren’t dead ends, they increase tension for everyone.\nCollapse = spotlight. Instead of removing players, collapse flips their role into world-shaping Encounters.\nGM-less pacing. The loop runs itself: stress and collapse provide natural escalation.\nAgendas = crawl inward. Players uncover hidden goals and themes as they collapse.\nLegacy = shared library. At the end of each crawl, one Agenda is chosen and uploaded to the vault for future groups to inherit.\n\n\nUsing This SRD\n\nYou may create your own games using the Memorycrawl system.\nReplace stats, tone, encounter tables, and agenda prompts to fit your setting.\nPlease include attribution: “This game is based on the Memorycrawl system by [Your Name].”\n\n\nExample Hacks\n\nReplace Body/Mind/Soul with Strength/Agility/Wits for a fantasy hack.\nReskin Agendas as “Nightmares” in a horror hack, or “Ambitions” in a political hack.\nUse Encounter Tables to model factions, disasters, or mysteries in your chosen world.\n\n\nLicense\nAttribution 4.0 International\n=======================================================================\nCreative Commons Corporation (“Creative Commons”) is not a law firm and\ndoes not provide legal services or legal advice.

You hexcrawl into wilderness, dungeon-crawl into stone tunnels, sandbox your way across an open world. The loop is expansion.\nBut what if the crawl didn’t go outwards, but inwards?\nThat’s the idea behind Memorycrawling — a structure where players don’t chart maps, but uncover buried memories, lost agendas, and fragments of their own making.\n\nHow Memorycrawling Works\n\n\nTokens as the Clock\nEach character carries a visible track of “tokens.” Failures and risks push it higher. When it fills, collapse triggers.\n\n\nCollapse as the Engine\nCollapse isn’t punishment. It’s progress. Each collapse pushes the story inward:\n\nA new encounter erupts into the world, altering the city.\nA fragment of the group’s lost agenda surfaces. The players begin to remember why they are here.\nA goal to create a new story fragment, how epic it might be.\n\n\n\nFragments as Legacy\nEvery campaign ends not with a “boss fight” but with a fragment, uploaded to a shared vault for future groups to start with. The world becomes denser and stranger over time.\n\n\n\nWhat Makes It Different\n\n\nWestmarches Turned Inward\nTraditional Westmarches play is outward — hexes revealed, maps filled, factions uncovered. Memorycrawling keeps the modular, persistent structure, but replaces geography with memory and collapse.\n\n\nNo GM, No Map\nInfection tokens, collapse triggers, and encounter tables drive the game. Players set their own pace by choosing easy/medium/hard risks. The world pushes back automatically.\n\n\nEmergent Narrative\nEncounters, agendas, and artifacts are oracular. Their order is unpredictable, but their escalation is inevitable. Each campaign tells a different story, but every story spirals down the same funnel: collapse, memory, artifact.\n\n\n\nWhy Memorycrawling Matters\nIt solves a common problem: too many RPGs need a GM to push the story forward. In Memorycrawling, the system itself is the storyteller. The players only decide how hard to push.\nThe result is an RPG loop that is:\n\nVisible (infection tokens on the table).\nInevitable (collapse always comes).\nPersistent (artifacts survive for the next group).\nEmergent (the crawl order is unique every time).\n\n\nClosing Thought\nWhere dungeon-crawls dig through stone, memorycrawls dig through people.\nWhere hexcrawls chart land, memorycrawls chart why you are here at all.\nYou don’t crawl out into the unknown.\nYou collapse in, again and again, until what was forgotten finally takes shape."},"Prolog":{"slug":"Prolog","filePath":"Prolog.md","title":"Prolog","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"You wake up in a narrow alley, heavy with the smell of salt, smoke, and rust. Your head buzzes — maybe too much drink last night. Or… was it? You can’t quite remember.\nOthers are here too, scattered across the stones as you were moments ago. Strangers? Friends? Their faces blur when you try to make them out in the shadows.\nThe entrance of the alley glows faintly. You push yourself up, moving toward it. The sky outside is dim and pressing, more twilight than day. The brightest light comes from flickering storefronts and lanterns set in odd patterns that don’t make sense right now.\nSuddenly, a person passes you — walking down the street, appearing from nowhere.\nYou raise a hand, but your voice is too frail to even form a breath.\nIf you focus, you can hear him whispering, his steps falling in rhythm with the count:\n“…one-thousand-forty-three… one-thousand-forty-four… one-thousand-forty-five…”\nThen other sounds crowd in: cats barking, someone… jumping? A television spills nonsense from a nearby window:\n“The waters are very calm today, here on the southside… And now on to the latest gossip about my mother.”\n“What… the fuck?” you whisper.\nThen, from seemingly everywhere, a booming ship horn echoes trough the alley… Within seconds after it subsided, you realize — the city went completely silent. Whatever that horn means, you feel it in your bones:\n“you are not supposed to be out here.”\nBehind you, a grunt. The others begin to wake, just as you did — shaken, disoriented, their breathing sharp.\nAs the others pull themselves upright, you notice something lying between you all — a package.\nIt’s wrapped in plain brown paper, tied with frayed twine, its corners darkened by damp.\nNo one remembers where it came from. Not you, not them. But there it is, written on top of it in a hurried hand:\n“Deliver to: 17 Ashen Row, Droskow.”\nNo further instructions. No sender’s name. Just that address.\nThe silence still hangs heavy in the air, as if the city is waiting."},"Syphons":{"slug":"Syphons","filePath":"Syphons.md","title":"Syphons","links":[],"tags":["invention"],"content":"Syphons are devices that are funnels with light sources in them, as soon as the light is swallowed by the dreg, it closes its lid and captures it inside of it.\nThink of it as as vacuum for spores, but way smaller and handheld.\nMost of them are built out of old record players, attached to a glass container.\nWhoever has a syphon can survive direct encounters with the dreg.\nSyphons are strange, hand-built devices — half reliquary, half tool — designed to capture and contain the Dreg’s spores. At first glance they look almost like antiques: clumsy assemblages of brass fittings, phonograph horns, and chipped glass. But in Droskow, these odd contraptions are the only thing that stands between a person and the suffocating embrace of the Dreg.\nThe Bulb: Each Syphon centers on a custom-built glass bulb. Unlike normal lamps, the bulb has a small iris-like aperture at its tip. When activated, light shines out briefly — a lure. The moment spores touch it, the glow collapses inward, and the aperture opens, sucking in the cloud like dust into a vacuum.\nAppearance\n\n\nThe Funnel: Most Syphons begin with the mouth of an old record player or gramophone, the wide metal bell reshaped into a focusing cone. Inside, filaments or bulbs glow faintly — scavenged lantern wicks, shattered lightbulbs strung with copper wire, or even phosphorescent fungus coaxed into glass tubes.\n\n\nThe Capture Jar: At the base of the funnel sits a sealed glass vessel, patched together with resin and solder. Some are crystalline and elegant, others are cloudy jars stained with the rainbow sheen of old chemicals. When spores are caught, the glass fogs, as if something is breathing against its walls.\n\n\nThe Mechanism: A spring-loaded lid or clattering shutter snaps shut the instant the light vanishes, locking the Dreg inside. The sound is distinctive — a sharp metallic clack that echoes like a gavel.\n\n\nThe Carrying Frame: Wrapped in leather straps, or bolted to bits of wood, Syphons can be slung across a back or held in both hands like a lantern. Most are heavier than they look, the parts dense with iron and stone weights to keep them steady.\n\n\nFunction\n\n\nWhen activated, the Syphon emits a small but steady glow. The Dreg, drawn to light, approaches.\n\n\nAs the spores close in, the glow falters — then is swallowed entirely. This triggers the Syphon’s shutter to slam shut, sealing the spores in the jar.\n\n\nA captured Dreg sample swirls like smoke in water, restless and alive, its glow ebbing and surging in strange pulses.\n\n\nUse in the City\n\n\nSurvival Tool: With a Syphon, someone can step into a Dreg-cloud and come back breathing. Without one, they risk being transformed or consumed.\n\n\nStatus Symbol: Because they’re rare and finicky to make, carrying a Syphon marks you as resourceful, or at least well-connected. Many owners decorate theirs with charms, paint, or inscriptions.\n\n\nTrade Good: Spores sealed inside a Syphon’s jar are valuable. Some claim they can be distilled into medicine, others into intoxicants, or even fuel. There are whispers of “spore markets” where jars change hands under torchlight.\n\n\nVariants\n\n\nThe Lantern-Syphon: A gramophone horn fixed to a street-lamp housing, carried by two hands like a holy lamp.\n\n\nThe Pocket-Syphon: A tiny device, no larger than a flask, favored by thieves and messengers. Fragile, often burns out after one or two uses.\n\n\nThe Reliquary-Syphon: Massive, ornate constructions built into the walls of shrines or homes. These don’t move — they protect a single place, humming faintly as if alive.\n\n"},"THE-THREAD-SRD":{"slug":"THE-THREAD-SRD","filePath":"THE-THREAD-SRD.md","title":"THE-THREAD-SRD","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Contents\n\nIntroduction\n\nWhat you need to play\n\n\nPillars\n\nPositive\nNegative\n\n\nSeal\n\nExploration\nCoherence\n\n\nCharacters\nStats\nStress\nCollapse\nEncounters\nArtifacts\nThreats\n\nExploratory\nGuided\n\n\nResolving Conflicts\n\nAs the challenged player\nAs the threatening player\nAs an encounter\nResolution\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nThread is a free form role-play system, for 2-6 players, that allows you to create immersive stories which are either led completely by the players, or are structured by a guide.\nWhat you need to play\n\nDice: Each player needs up to 6 six-sided dice (D6).\nCharacter Sheet: Downloadable here.\nA unique physical object for the Seal token (e.g., a coin, stone, or figurine).\nImagination: For collaborative storytelling and world-building.\n\n\nPillars\nBefore the story begins, the party defines its pillars — the shared vibe, direction, and boundaries of play.\nWrite them down before diving into play, preferably on a single sheet of paper.\nPillars should be agreed on together — they are not plot hooks, but a contract that frames the story.\nEach player may set up to 3 Positive and 3 Negative Pillars.\nPositive\nThings you want to experience.\n\nI like Romance\nMagic is real\nWe should feel epic\n\nNegative\nThings you do not want.\n\nNo Blood and Violence\nLet’s not leave the City.\nNo over the top comedy\n\n\nSeal\nThis is a token, which represents both a safety and a story tool. It ensures the party can choose when threats should be allowed and reminds everyone at the table to keep the story tight.\nOne player begins the game with the token, it can be any unique object you have around.\nThe token may only be used once per scene.\nExploration\nIf the holder places it in the center of the table, no new threats may be declared. Narration continues freely, focusing on character and story instead of conflict.\nAny player may take it from the center if they feel the party is ready for threats again.\nCoherence\nIt may also be passed directly from one player to another as a gentle signal,\n“Can we stay closer to the story?”\nThis is never a punishment. It is a nudge to keep tone, focus, and pacing in harmony.\nIf whoever feels like the current owner is misusing the Seal, The party can decide to give it to a new player.\nIf there is a dispute or something is unclear, the person with the Seal decides, then give it to the one who was overruled.\n\nCharacters\nYour character is the lens through which you experience this world.\nIn this game, both, characters and encounters are functionally the same. They only differ due to encounters having story relevant information.\nCharacters and encounters consist of:\n\nA name\nA description (and an image/mini if you like)\nComposure - how much stress you can endure (default max 12)\n3 Stats (Fitness, Reason, Instinct)\nSeveral Artifacts (default max 6)\nCritical Sequence\n\n\nStats\nEach character and encounter has a stat-block.\nThey define how many dice you can use in a roll.\nThe Stats consist of:\n\nFitness (FIT)\n\nIf the obstacle would yield to muscle, stamina, or raw coordination\n\n\nReason (RES)\n\nIf thinking, noticing, or planning beats brawn or force of will\n\n\nInstinct (INS)\n\nIf the scene needs persuasion or manipulation\n\n\n\nWhen creating a character, spend 3 points however you like.\nThe distribution will inform how you role-play your character.\n\nExample: FIT 3, RES 0, INS 0, makes you strong… but not very bright.\n\n\nInfection\nInfection measures how much spores your character can endure before they collapse. It represents physical exhaustion, mental pressure, and emotional weight all at once.\nEach character begins with a Resistance of 3.\nWhenever you lose a conflict, you gain Spores equal to the declared Threat Level. Some Artifacts may also require you to take Spores in, in order to use them.\nIf your Spore-Infection reaches your Resistance, your character collapses.\n\nCollapse\nWhen your Infection reaches your current Resistance, your character collapses. This doesn’t mean they are gone forever, but it does mean they can be an active part of role-play, for now.\nAt this moment, your character becomes an Encounter — part of the world rather than a player’s protagonist.\nOnce the encounter you became is resolved or leaves the story, you return as your character. When you awaken, increase your Composure by +1 up to a maximum of 12.\n\nEncounters\nEncounters are the living pulse of the world — rivals, allies, strangers, or even forces of nature. They exist to challenge the party, reveal secrets, and drive the story forward.\nWhile mechanically they function just like characters, an encounter always has two additional things:\n\nA Goal — what they want to achieve, protect, or prevent.\nInformation — a truth, clue, or piece of knowledge they carry that becomes clear when their goal slips away.\n\nWhen an encounter fails to achieve its goal or is defeated in a roll, it reveals the information it holds. This might be a secret, a map, a weakness, or even a hint about greater threats.\nUnlike characters, encounters lose spores instead of gaining it when they fail. If their infection is reduced to 0, the encounter disappears from the story. Before they fade, they drop one of their artifacts, which other players may claim. If that player already carries their maximum of artifacts, they must discard one to pick it up.\nEncounter Scaling\nWhen setting an encounter’s difficulty, choose one of these approaches:\n\nLowest Party Composure → Encounters are easier; best for lighter, story-focused play. (default)\nHighest Party Composure → Encounters are tougher; best for groups that want more challenge.\nCurrent Player’s Composure → Difficulty shifts dynamically depending on who is facing the  threat; best for experienced groups that enjoy unpredictability.\n\n\nArtifacts\nArtifacts are strange phenomenon of power. No one fully understands them — they are discovered through play and carried by inhabitants of the world.\nAn Artifact always has a dominant stat. This is the stat it resonates with most strongly. When a character uses an Artifact:\n\n\nIf the character’s value in the dominant stat is equal to or higher than the Artifact’s requirement, they may roll the listed number of bonus dice without cost.\n\n\nIf the character’s value is lower, they can still use it, but must take Stress equal to the difference between their stat and the Artifact’s requirement.\nCharacters Body Stat = +2\nArtifact Requirement = Body +3\nPlayer needs to take 1 Stress to use it.\n\n\nThis means any character can attempt to wield any Artifact, but not without risk. The further away it is from their nature, the more it strains them.\nArtifacts are powerful, but they are also burdens. A character can only carry as many Artifacts as their Composure to a maximum of 6.\n\nAt Composure 1, you may carry 1 Artifact.\nAt Composure 2, you may carry 2 Artifacts.\nAnd so on… until 6.\n\nIf you gain a new Artifact while already at your maximum, you must discard or trade one you hold.\nArtifacts are not just tools — they are also story seeds. Their origins, side-effects, and true purposes can be explored as the parties wishes. They may help, they may harm… but often they do both.\n\nThreats\nThis game can be played in several modes. It depends on the fact if you have an adventure prepared, or if you want to play in a free form improvisation mode.\nExploratory\nIn exploratory style, each character can oppose another and demand a roll. The opposition may propose one or multiple stats that apply, and a Threat Level. If the table finds the threat to harsh or generally unjustified, the seal might be used.\nGuided\nIf any one person has a specific story or adventure in mind, they can choose to become the guide.\nThe guide can demand rolls if a player does something risky and guide the players through the story. Keeping them on track.\n\nResolving Conflicts\nWhenever you are threatened by an encounter or another character, you will need to roll dice to determine the result.\nBefore a roll, the opposing player or guide declares a threat whenever the outcome seems uncertain. The threat needs to be made in one of the stats category (FIT, RES, INS), and have one of the 3 levels listed below. The table can veto if the level feels unjustified, using the Seal if needed.\nLevels\n\nMinor - small stakes, low risk\nRisky - significant stakes\nFatal - high stakes, dramatic events\n\nIf challenged, roll 3 dice.\nFor Minor, sum all dice + Stat.\nFor Risky, remove the lowest dice + Stat.\nFor Fatal, remove highest dice + Stat.\nIf you are below 9, you failed.\nIf you are exactly at 9, you succeed, but with a complication.\nIf you are above 9, you won.\nResolution\nWinner\nNarrates the outcome.\nComplication\nChallenger can add a twist that makes it harder for you to tell your story.\nLoser:\nCharacters gain an Stress equal to the Level:\nEncounters lose Stress equal to the Level:\n\nMinor → 1 Stress\nRisky → 2 Stress\nFatal → 3 Stress\n\nTies are in favor of the challenged player.\n\nParty Wipes\nWhen each member of the party is an encounter, the party is considered wiped.\nYou can choose to continue playing as your current encounters/NPCS, that just means you will take over the Stats, Name and Description of the encounter.\n\nImprovisation Tools\nImprovisation is the heart of collaborative storytelling. These simple techniques help keep the story flowing, build on each other’s ideas, and avoid stalls at the table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, andNo, andYes, butNo, but\nYes, And…\n\nAccept what another player has said as true (Yes…) and then add to it (…and…).\nExample:\n\nPlayer A: “The library is locked.”\nPlayer B: “Yes, and the old caretaker left a key hidden under a loose brick.”\n\n\n\nThis keeps momentum going instead of shutting things down.\nYes, But…\n\nAccept what was said, but introduce a twist or complication.\nExample:\n\nPlayer A: “The door swings open.”\nPlayer B: “Yes, but it creaks so loudly that everyone nearby hears it.”\n\n\n\nThis adds drama while still moving the story forward.\nNo, And…\n\nReject the suggestion and escalate the situation by adding a new obstacle or complication.\nExample:\n\nPlayer A: “I cut the rope before the guard notices.”\nPlayer B: “No, and the rope snaps back, knocking over a lantern that sets the curtains on fire.”\n\n\n\nThis is the harshest option — use it sparingly — but it can heighten tension and push the story into unexpected directions.\nNo, But…\n\nReject the direct suggestion, but offer an alternative that still gives the other player something.\nExample:\n\nPlayer A: “I find gold coins in the chest.”\nPlayer B: “No, but you do find a strange artifact with markings you don’t understand.”\n\n\n\nThis prevents dead ends while still steering the story.\nAsk Questions\nIf you’re stuck, turn the spotlight back:\n\n“What do you see?”\n“How does your character feel about this?”\n\nQuestions keep everyone invested and share the creative load across the table.\nBuild on Pillars\nWhen improvising, return to the agreed Positive and Negative Pillars. They’re a compass:\n\nPositive Pillar → lean into it when you want to heighten drama or add color.\nNegative Pillar → use it as a boundary to stay in tone and avoid derailing play.\n\nUse the Seal\nThe Seal isn’t just safety — it’s also a pacing tool.\n\nIf the table is drifting or stalling, pass the Seal as a gentle way to signal: “Let’s pull this back to focus.”\n\nTip: These tools aren’t rules you must follow every time. Think of them as tricks in your pocket — when you’re unsure what to do, pick one and the story will keep flowing.\nHidden Meta Layer\nTHIS INFO IS NOT VISIBLE TO THE PLAYER BEFORE THE FIRST PLAYTHROUGH\nThe hidden meta layer of this system is, that at the end of one character (reached his max composure level), the player can choose to upload his current character and one known item/entity/ability that they created during play into an online vault.\nThis vault is then used to feed new character creation and drives the random encounters.\nThe character sheet and encounter selection will happen through a web app.\nThis layer is only unlocked when you played through the game once.\n--- PLUS RULE"},"The-River":{"slug":"The-River","filePath":"The River.md","title":"The River","links":["Droskow"],"tags":["location"],"content":"Little is remembered of the river upon which Droskow was founded.

Meanwhile, those who appear “healthy,” clinging to a fading ideal of normalcy, are the ones truly diminished, their resistance to the Dreg rendering them hollow or obsessive. The package, marked for 17 Ashen Row, becomes the campaign’s crux—a device that could either spread the Dreg’s transformative spores to the players, embracing their humanity through “sickness,” or purge the Dreg from Droskow, restoring a sterile “health” that might strip the city of its vitality.
