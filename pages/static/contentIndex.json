Whenever a spore drifts close to matter, nearby spores converge on it like iron filings to a magnet. The touched object isn’t destroyed — it disfigures and mangles it’s meaning. The result is always strange, unpredictable, and somehow useful, though never in ways the sane would choose.\nThe Dreg seeps up from beneath Droskow. Along the canals and mudflats, the earth swells and bubbles with trapped gases. Small pops pass unnoticed, but sometimes a great blister bursts. Its echo carries through the crooked streets, and with it comes a cloud of spores. These spores cling to anything living — or inert — twisting meaning, purpose, and shape alike.\nNo investigator of the Dreg has ever returned sane. The city can’t understand it, can’t cure it — only contain it.\nContainment\nThe most common defense are Syphons: devices devised by desperate minds to draw spores in and lock them away.

From those waters the hamlet grew into a town, and the town into a city.\nNow, the river has dwindled to mud and puddles. Everything in Droskow is clammy and dry at once. The Canals, once crowded with barges and cargo, lie as sticky trenches of drifting sludge. From these puddles the first breath of the Dreg escaped. A bubble swelled in the heart of the city — larger than any before — and after a long, uneasy week, it burst. Life changed, and so did the city. Trade is dead, but somehow, no one starves.

It ensures the party can choose when threats should be allowed and reminds everyone at the table to keep the story tight.\nOne player begins the game with the token, it can be any unique object you have around.\nThe token may only be used once per scene.\nExploration\nIf the holder places it in the center of the table, no new threats may be declared. Narration continues freely, focusing on character and story instead of conflict.\nAny player may take it from the center if they feel the party is ready for threats again.\nCoherence\nIt may also be passed directly from one player to another as a gentle signal,\n“Can we stay closer to the story?”\nThis is never a punishment. It is a nudge to keep tone, focus, and pacing in harmony.\nIf whoever feels like the current owner is misusing the Seal, The party can decide to give it to a new player.\nIf there is a dispute or something is unclear, the person with the Seal decides, then give it to the one who was overruled.\n\nCharacters\nYour character is the lens through which you experience this world.\nIn this game, both, characters and encounters are functionally the same. They only differ due to encounters having story relevant information.\nCharacters and encounters consist of:\n\nA name\nA description (and an image/mini if you like)\nComposure - how much stress you can endure (default max 12)\n3 Stats (Fitness, Reason, Instinct)\nSeveral Artifacts (default max 6)\nCritical Sequence\n\n\nCritical Sequence\nWhen you create a new character, roll 2D6.\nThe result becomes your Critical Sequence — two special numbers unique to your character.\nWhenever you roll dice during play:\n\nIf one of your dice matches a number from your Critical Sequence, that die counts as a guaranteed success.\nThe same applies to your opposition — every character and encounter has their own Critical Sequence.\n\nDouble Criticals\nIf both sides roll a critical success in the same conflict, the challenged player wins the resolution.\nExample\n\nAlice’s Critical Sequence is 4 and 6.\nShe rolls 3 dice during a conflict and gets 2, 4, 6.\nBecause she rolled a 4 AND 6, she triggers a guaranteed success, no matter the opposition’s total.\n\n\nStats\nEach character and encounter has a stat-block.\nThey define how many dice you can use in a roll.\nThe Stats consist of:\n\nFitness (FIT)\n\nIf the obstacle would yield to muscle, stamina, or raw coordination\n\n\nReason (RES)\n\nIf thinking, noticing, or planning beats brawn or force of will\n\n\nInstinct (INS)\n\nIf the scene needs persuasion or manipulation\n\n\n\nWhen creating a character, spend 3 points however you like.\nThe distribution will inform how you role-play your character.\n\nExample: FIT 3, RES 0, INS 0, makes you strong… but not very bright.\n\n\nStress\nStress measures how much strain your character can endure before they collapse. It represents physical exhaustion, mental pressure, and emotional weight all at once.\nEach character begins with a Composure of 3.\nWhenever you lose a conflict, you gain Stress equal to the declared Threat Level. Some Artifacts may also require you to take Stress in order to use them.\nIf your Stress reaches your Composure, your character collapses.\n\nCollapse\nWhen your Stress reaches your current Composure, your character collapses. This doesn’t mean they are gone forever, but it does mean they can be an active part of role-play, for now.\nAt this moment, your character becomes an Encounter — part of the world rather than a player’s protagonist.\nOnce the encounter you became is resolved or leaves the story, you return as your character. When you awaken, increase your Composure by +1 up to a maximum of 12.\n\nEncounters\nEncounters are the living pulse of the world — rivals, allies, strangers, or even forces of nature. They exist to challenge the party, reveal secrets, and drive the story forward.\nWhile mechanically they function just like characters, an encounter always has two additional things:\n\nA Goal — what they want to achieve, protect, or prevent.\nInformation — a truth, clue, or piece of knowledge they carry that becomes clear when their goal slips away.\n\nWhen an encounter fails to achieve its goal or is defeated in a roll, it reveals the information it holds. This might be a secret, a map, a weakness, or even a hint about greater threats.\nUnlike characters, encounters lose stress instead of gaining it when they fail. If their stress is reduced to 0, the encounter disappears from the story. Before they fade, they drop one of their artifacts, which other players may claim. If that player already carries their maximum of artifacts, they must discard one to pick it up.\nEncounter Scaling\nWhen setting an encounter’s difficulty, choose one of these approaches:\n\nLowest Party Composure → Encounters are easier; best for lighter, story-focused play. (default)\nHighest Party Composure → Encounters are tougher; best for groups that want more challenge.\nCurrent Player’s Composure → Difficulty shifts dynamically depending on who is facing the  threat; best for experienced groups that enjoy unpredictability.\n\n\nArtifacts\nArtifacts are strange phenomenon of power. No one fully understands them — they are discovered through play and carried by inhabitants of the world.\nAn Artifact always has a dominant stat. This is the stat it resonates with most strongly. When a character uses an Artifact:\n\n\nIf the character’s value in the dominant stat is equal to or higher than the Artifact’s requirement, they may roll the listed number of bonus dice without cost.\n\n\nIf the character’s value is lower, they can still use it, but must take Stress equal to the difference between their stat and the Artifact’s requirement.\nCharacters Body Stat = +2\nArtifact Requirement = Body +3\nPlayer needs to take 1 Stress to use it.\n\n\nThis means any character can attempt to wield any Artifact, but not without risk. The further away it is from their nature, the more it strains them.\nArtifacts are powerful, but they are also burdens. A character can only carry as many Artifacts as their Composure to a maximum of 6.\n\nAt Composure 1, you may carry 1 Artifact.\nAt Composure 2, you may carry 2 Artifacts.\nAnd so on… until 6.\n\nIf you gain a new Artifact while already at your maximum, you must discard or trade one you hold.\nArtifacts are not just tools — they are also story seeds. Their origins, side-effects, and true purposes can be explored as the parties wishes. They may help, they may harm… but often they do both.\n\nThreats\nThis game can be played in several modes. It depends on the fact if you have an adventure prepared, or if you want to play in a free form improvisation mode.\nExploratory\nIn exploratory style, each character can oppose another and demand a roll. The opposition may propose one or multiple stats that apply, and a Threat Level. If the table finds the threat to harsh or generally unjustified, the seal might be used.\nGuided\nIf any one person has a specific story or adventure in mind, they can choose to become the guide.\nThe guide can demand rolls if a player does something risky and guide the players through the story. Keeping them on track.\n\nResolving Conflicts\nWhenever you are threatened by an encounter or another character, you will need to roll dice to determine the result.\nBefore a roll, the opposing player or guide declares a threat whenever the outcome seems uncertain. The threat needs to be made in one of the stats category (FIT, RES, INS), and have one of the 3 levels listed below. The table can veto if the level feels unjustified, using the Seal if needed.\nAll rolls use 1D6 at minimum.\nLevels\n\nMinor +1D6 - small stakes, low risk\nRisky +2D6 - significant stakes\nFatal +3D6 - high stakes, dramatic events\n\nWhen narration is opposed, resolve it with a roll.Each side gathers dice from Stats, Artifacts, and the declared Level.\nThe highest sum of the roll decides the winner.\nAs the challenged player\n\nadd the amount of D6 for the challenged stat (FIT, RES, INS)\nWhen using an Artifact, add D6 based on its description and pay its cost.\n\nAs the threatening player\n\nAdd the amount of D6 based on the Level\n\nAs an encounter\n\nadd the amount of D6 for the challenged stat (FIT, RES, INS)\nAdd the amount of D6 based on the Level\n\nResolution\nWinner\nNarrates the outcome.\nLoser:\nCharacters gain Stress equal to the Level:\nEncounters lose Stress equal to the Level:\n\nMinor → 1 Stress\nRisky → 2 Stress\nFatal → 3 Stress\n\nTies are in favor of the challenged player.\n\nParty Wipes\nWhen each member of the party is an encounter, the party is considered wiped.\nYou can choose to continue playing as your current encounters/NPCS, that just means you will take over the Stats, Name and Description of the encounter.\n\nImprovisation Tools\nImprovisation is the heart of collaborative storytelling. These simple techniques help keep the story flowing, build on each other’s ideas, and avoid stalls at the table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, andNo, andYes, butNo, but\nYes, And…\n\nAccept what another player has said as true (Yes…) and then add to it (…and…).\nExample:\n\nPlayer A: “The library is locked.”\nPlayer B: “Yes, and the old caretaker left a key hidden under a loose brick.”\n\n\n\nThis keeps momentum going instead of shutting things down.\nYes, But…\n\nAccept what was said, but introduce a twist or complication.\nExample:\n\nPlayer A: “The door swings open.”\nPlayer B: “Yes, but it creaks so loudly that everyone nearby hears it.”\n\n\n\nThis adds drama while still moving the story forward.\nNo, And…\n\nReject the suggestion and escalate the situation by adding a new obstacle or complication.\nExample:\n\nPlayer A: “I cut the rope before the guard notices.”\nPlayer B: “No, and the rope snaps back, knocking over a lantern that sets the curtains on fire.”\n\n\n\nThis is the harshest option — use it sparingly — but it can heighten tension and push the story into unexpected directions.\nNo, But…\n\nReject the direct suggestion, but offer an alternative that still gives the other player something.\nExample:\n\nPlayer A: “I find gold coins in the chest.”\nPlayer B: “No, but you do find a strange artifact with markings you don’t understand.”\n\n\n\nThis prevents dead ends while still steering the story.\nAsk Questions\nIf you’re stuck, turn the spotlight back:\n\n“What do you see?”\n“How does your character feel about this?”\n\nQuestions keep everyone invested and share the creative load across the table.\nBuild on Pillars\nWhen improvising, return to the agreed Positive and Negative Pillars. They’re a compass:\n\nPositive Pillar → lean into it when you want to heighten drama or add color.\nNegative Pillar → use it as a boundary to stay in tone and avoid derailing play.\n\nUse the Seal\nThe Seal isn’t just safety — it’s also a pacing tool.\n\nIf the table is drifting or stalling, pass the Seal as a gentle way to signal: “Let’s pull this back to focus.”\n\nTip: These tools aren’t rules you must follow every time. Think of them as tricks in your pocket — when you’re unsure what to do, pick one and the story will keep flowing.\nHidden Meta Layer\nTHIS INFO IS NOT VISIBLE TO THE PLAYER BEFORE THE FIRST PLAYTHROUGH\nThe hidden meta layer of this system is, that at the end of one character (reached his max composure level), the player can choose to upload his current character and one known item/entity/ability that they created during play into an online vault.\nThis vault is then used to feed new character creation and drives the random encounters.\nThe character sheet and encounter selection will happen through a web app.\nThis layer is only unlocked when you played through the game once.\n--- PLUS RULE"},"The-River":{"slug":"The-River","filePath":"The River.md","title":"The River","links":["Droskow"],"tags":["location"],"content":"Little is remembered of the river upon which Droskow was founded.
