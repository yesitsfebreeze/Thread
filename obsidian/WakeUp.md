You wake up in a narrow alley, heavy with the smell of salt, smoke, and rust. your head buzzes — maybe from too much drink last night. or… was it? you can’t quite remember.

Others are here too, scattered across the stones like you were moments ago. Strangers? Friends? — you do not know their faces blur as you try to make them out in the shadows.

The entrance of the alley glows faintly. You push yourself up, moving toward it. The sky outside is dim and pressing, more twilight than day. The most light comes from flickering empty storefronts and lanterns scattered around the street i odd patterns, not making sense to you right now.

As suddenly; a person passes by you walking down the street, seemingly coming out of nowhere.

You hold up your hand but your voice is to frail to even make a breath.

If you focus, you can hear a slight echo of murmured numbers:

“…onethousandforty-three… onethousandforty-four… onethousandforty-five…”

His steps seem to fall in rhythm with the count.

As you pull out of this strange encounter, your ears begin to pick up things;

cats barking, sounds of someone.... jumping? A TV, out of a window close to you, blurts "The waters are very calmn today, here on the the southside... And now on to the latest gossip about my mother"

You whisper under your breath

What.. the ... fuck?

and then, from seemingly every, a booming ship horn echoes trough the alley...

Within seconds after it subsided, you realize — the city went completely silent.

Whatever that horn means, you feel it in your bones: you are not supposed to be out here.
  

Behind you, a grunt. a stir. The others begin to wake, just as you did — shaken, disoriented, their breathing sharp.
