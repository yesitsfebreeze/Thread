A creaky old bar on the cusp of breaking apart. Settled on the edge of the wall, people still wonder why it stands.
The air is damp and smells like a mix of old people and young sweat. Disgusting, but the most people in there don't care, or can't. It has a small adjacent building which looks more like a makeshift shed than a hostel, but that is what it is supposed to be.

People can rest here for some [[Chip|chip]], but don't expect comfort.
