You wake up in a narrow alley, heavy with the smell of salt, smoke, and rust. Your head buzzes — maybe too much drink last night. Or… was it? You can’t quite remember.

Others are here too, scattered across the stones as you were moments ago. Strangers? Friends? Their faces blur when you try to make them out in the shadows.

The entrance of the alley glows faintly. You push yourself up, moving toward it. The sky outside is dim and pressing, more twilight than day. The brightest light comes from flickering storefronts and lanterns set in odd patterns that don’t make sense right now.

Suddenly, a person passes you — walking down the street, appearing from nowhere.

You raise a hand, but your voice is too frail to even form a breath.

If you focus, you can hear him whispering, his steps falling in rhythm with the count:  
“…one-thousand-forty-three… one-thousand-forty-four… one-thousand-forty-five…”

Then other sounds crowd in: cats barking, someone… jumping? A television spills nonsense from a nearby window:  
_“The waters are very calm today, here on the southside… And now on to the latest gossip about my mother.”_

“What… the fuck?” you whisper.

Then, from seemingly everywhere, a booming ship horn echoes trough the alley... Within seconds after it subsided, you realize — the city went completely silent. Whatever that horn means, you feel it in your bones:
"you are not supposed to be out here."

Behind you, a grunt. The others begin to wake, just as you did — shaken, disoriented, their breathing sharp.
As the others pull themselves upright, you notice something lying between you all — a package.  
It’s wrapped in plain brown paper, tied with frayed twine, its corners darkened by damp.

No one remembers where it came from. Not you, not them. But there it is, written on top of it in a hurried hand:
**“Deliver to: 17 Ashen Row, Droskow.”**

No further instructions. No sender’s name. Just that address.

The silence still hangs heavy in the air, as if the city is waiting.
