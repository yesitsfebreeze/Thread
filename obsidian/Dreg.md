The Dreg is a spore like substance that seems to swallow light whenever it gets close. Once it touches something, nearby spores attract to it like a magnet, consuming whatever it touches. But it does not destroy, it transforms everything into something... weird, something... useful?  

The most common way to encounter the Dreg, is trough gas bubbles that erupt from time to time throughout the canals spread in the city. 


It seems like to come out of the earth itself, the mud bubbles, bloats and distorts, until it bursts and spores escape. No one ever returned sane from investigating the Dreg. So the only thing the people of Droskow can do, is to try to contain it.

Far more smart people invented [[Syphons]] 











I think i call it "The Dreg", once the river/sea dried out, there is a constant slow and eerie popping of bubbles from the dreg that bubbles up trough the muddy surface. Small bubbles dont have any effects. but every now and then a big bubble pursts and creating a loud pop that can be heard echoing trough the streets. when this happens the mud releases spores that can inhabit the living or inanimate objects and transform their meaning.




i think what i dislike and we hickup, is that you "question" my vision due to the fact that you tell me "but thats not fun for players". Like.. what im getting at, is that THIS FACT should not matter to you at all. What should matter is: "can i bend this base to fit my needs?". So the discussions about if i want to make them one time use in my game or not, should not be on the table.
