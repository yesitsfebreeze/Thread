The **Dreg** is a spore-like substance that swallows light, warmth, and motion itself — drawn to anything that lives, stirs, or burns. Whenever a spore drifts close to matter, nearby spores converge on it like iron filings to a magnet. The touched object isn’t destroyed — it disfigures and mangles it's meaning. The result is always strange, unpredictable, and somehow _useful_, though never in ways the sane would choose.

The Dreg seeps up from beneath Droskow. Along the canals and mudflats, the earth swells and bubbles with trapped gases. Small pops pass unnoticed, but sometimes a great blister bursts. Its echo carries through the crooked streets, and with it comes a cloud of spores. These spores cling to anything living — or inert — twisting meaning, purpose, and shape alike.

No investigator of the Dreg has ever returned sane. The city can’t understand it, can’t cure it — only contain it.

### Containment

The most common defense are [[Syphons]]: devices devised by desperate minds to draw spores in and lock them away. Syphons don’t cleanse the Dreg; they merely trap it, bottled until someone foolish or desperate enough decides to uncork it again.
