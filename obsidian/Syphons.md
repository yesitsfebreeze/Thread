Syphons are devices that are funnels with light sources in them, as soon as the light is swallowed by the dreg, it closes its lid and captures it inside of it.

Think of it as as vacuum for spores, but way smaller and handheld.
Most of them are built out of old record players, attached to a glass container.

Whoever has a syphon can survive direct encounters with the dreg.



**Syphons** are strange, hand-built devices — half reliquary, half tool — designed to capture and contain the Dreg’s spores. At first glance they look almost like antiques: clumsy assemblages of brass fittings, phonograph horns, and chipped glass. But in Droskow, these odd contraptions are the only thing that stands between a person and the suffocating embrace of the Dreg.

**The Bulb**: Each Syphon centers on a custom-built glass bulb. Unlike normal lamps, the bulb has a small **iris-like aperture** at its tip. When activated, light shines out briefly — a lure. The moment spores touch it, the glow collapses inward, and the aperture opens, sucking in the cloud like dust into a vacuum.

### Appearance

- **The Funnel**: Most Syphons begin with the mouth of an old record player or gramophone, the wide metal bell reshaped into a focusing cone. Inside, filaments or bulbs glow faintly — scavenged lantern wicks, shattered lightbulbs strung with copper wire, or even phosphorescent fungus coaxed into glass tubes.
    
- **The Capture Jar**: At the base of the funnel sits a sealed glass vessel, patched together with resin and solder. Some are crystalline and elegant, others are cloudy jars stained with the rainbow sheen of old chemicals. When spores are caught, the glass fogs, as if something is breathing against its walls.
    
- **The Mechanism**: A spring-loaded lid or clattering shutter snaps shut the instant the light vanishes, locking the Dreg inside. The sound is distinctive — a sharp metallic _clack_ that echoes like a gavel.
    
- **The Carrying Frame**: Wrapped in leather straps, or bolted to bits of wood, Syphons can be slung across a back or held in both hands like a lantern. Most are heavier than they look, the parts dense with iron and stone weights to keep them steady.
    

### Function

- When activated, the Syphon emits a small but steady glow. The Dreg, drawn to light, approaches.
    
- As the spores close in, the glow falters — then is swallowed entirely. This triggers the Syphon’s shutter to slam shut, sealing the spores in the jar.
    
- A captured Dreg sample swirls like smoke in water, restless and alive, its glow ebbing and surging in strange pulses.
    

### Use in the City

- **Survival Tool**: With a Syphon, someone can step into a Dreg-cloud and come back breathing. Without one, they risk being transformed or consumed.
    
- **Status Symbol**: Because they’re rare and finicky to make, carrying a Syphon marks you as resourceful, or at least well-connected. Many owners decorate theirs with charms, paint, or inscriptions.
    
- **Trade Good**: Spores sealed inside a Syphon’s jar are valuable. Some claim they can be distilled into medicine, others into intoxicants, or even fuel. There are whispers of “spore markets” where jars change hands under torchlight.
    

### Variants

- **The Lantern-Syphon**: A gramophone horn fixed to a street-lamp housing, carried by two hands like a holy lamp.
    
- **The Pocket-Syphon**: A tiny device, no larger than a flask, favored by thieves and messengers. Fragile, often burns out after one or two uses.
    
- **The Reliquary-Syphon**: Massive, ornate constructions built into the walls of shrines or homes. These don’t move — they protect a single place, humming faintly as if alive.
