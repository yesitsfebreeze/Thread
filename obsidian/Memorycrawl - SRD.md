It provides the core rules of the **Memorycrawl** roleplaying engine.  
You are free to hack, adapt, and publish your own games using this system, with attribution.

---

## Core Concept

**Memorycrawl** is a GM-less roleplaying engine where risk and failure don’t stop the story — they escalate it.  

- **Misses** don’t block play: they add stress, pushing characters toward collapse.  
- **Collapse** doesn’t remove you from the game: it flips the spotlight, triggering Encounters and adding new items.  
- **Agendas** are shuffled prompts written by the players at the start, slowly revealed in play, and one is chosen as the legacy to be uploaded at the end.  

---

## Characters

Each player controls one character, defined by:

- **Stats**: Body, Mind, Soul.  
  - Distribute **5 points** among them (max 3 in any one stat).  
- **Composure**: How much stress you can endure. Starts at **3**.  
- **Agenda**: A hidden prompt, written by other players.  
- **Items**: Empty slots for special powers gained in play.  
  - Roll once on the Item-Table at the beginning to start with on of them.  

---

## Agendas

At the start of play:  
- Each player secretly writes one sentence of something they want to see in the story (a goal, twist, image, theme).  
- Fold and shuffle the papers, then redistribute so no one gets their own.  
- This becomes your hidden **Agenda**.  

When you archive your agenda, you unlock an additional Item-Slot.
The maximum items you can carry is limited to *6* by default.

Agendas are archived when you fulfilled the main task it outlines.
This can be tricky to judge sometimes, depending on the way it is written. If there is doubt and you think you finished it, reveal it to the table and state what you archived. If the table disagrees, they now know your agenda, but you still have to complete it.

At the end of play, the group selects one Agenda to upload as the legacy outcome for future games.  

---

## Taking Actions

Players narrate freely until someone calls an action **risky**.  
The table agrees on:  
- **Difficulty** (1 = low, 2 = medium, 3 = high).  
- **Relevant Stat** (Body, Mind, or Soul).  

Roll **3D6**:  
- **Low difficulty** → sum all 3 dice + stat.  
- **Medium difficulty** → sum the highest 2 dice + stat.  
- **High difficulty** → sum the lowest 2 dice + stat.  

**Results:**  
- **< 9** → fail. Another player narrates the outcome. You take Stress = difficulty.  
- **= 9** → success with complication. You narrate; another player adds a twist. Take Stress = difficulty.  
- **> 9** → success. You narrate freely.  

---

## Stress & Collapse

- Track stress with tokens.  
- When your stress equals your composure, you **collapse**.  
- Your character is temporarily out of play.  

---

## Encounters

When you collapse:  
- You take over an **Encounter** (NPC, faction, or world event).  
- Roll on the Encounter Table to see what enters play.  
- Encounters run on the stress tokens you built up — play them until those tokens are cleared.  

Encounters also drop **Items**:  
- Each time an encounter ends, roll once on the Item-Table.  
- The encounter will then drop this item.
- One player may pick it up if desired.
- If their slots are full, they must discard another to put it in their inventory.

### Collapse & Return

- When you collapse, your character is out of play and you take over an Encounter.
- The Encounter begins with Stress tokens equal to the Stress you had built up.
- Each action the Encounter takes reduces its Stress pool by 1.
- When the Encounter’s Stress reaches 0, it is resolved, and your character returns to play at **0 Stress**.
    
- If the party flees or abandons the Encounter, the player decides whether to:
    - **Return with them**, treating the Encounter as failed, or
    - **Stay with the Encounter**, and try to engage/follow the players, until its Stress is spent.

---

## Items

Items are items gained through encounters.  

- Each item grants **+1 to +3** to a specific stat roll.  
- If you don’t meet the required stat level, using it costs **+1 Stress**.  
- Items last until the end of the play when its not used up.  
  
They are rolled from a 3 Level Item-Table.
- Uses
  *How many times it can be used before it breaks.*
- objects
  **What shape the item takes in the story (item, memory, ability, etc.).
- Bonus & Requirement
  *Which stat it boosts, and what minimum stat is required to use it without stress.*

 
---

## End Condition

Play continues until **all players are collapsed at the same time**.  

At that point, the group decides:  
- **End the crawl**: record one Agenda as the legacy and upload it to the vault.  
- **Continue**: keep playing as Encounters, spiraling deeper into the story.  

---

## The Loop

1. Narrate → risk → roll.  
2. Miss/complication → gain stress.  
3. Stress fills → collapse.  
4. Collapse → encounter.  
5. Encounter resolves → items gained.  
6. Repeat until all collapse → end or continue.  

---

## Design Principles

- **Misses = escalation.** Failures aren’t dead ends, they increase tension for everyone.  
- **Collapse = spotlight.** Instead of removing players, collapse flips their role into world-shaping Encounters.  
- **GM-less pacing.** The loop runs itself: stress and collapse provide natural escalation.  
- **Agendas = crawl inward.** Players uncover hidden goals and themes as they collapse.  
- **Legacy = shared library.** At the end of each crawl, one Agenda is chosen and uploaded to the vault for future groups to inherit.  

---

# Using This SRD

- You may create your own games using the Memorycrawl system.  
- Replace **stats**, **tone**, **encounter tables**, and **agenda prompts** to fit your setting.  
- Please include attribution: *“This game is based on the Memorycrawl system by [Your Name].”*  

---

# Example Hacks

- Replace Body/Mind/Soul with Strength/Agility/Wits for a fantasy hack.  
- Reskin Agendas as “Nightmares” in a horror hack, or “Ambitions” in a political hack.  
- Use Encounter Tables to model factions, disasters, or mysteries in your chosen world.

Section 2 -- Scope.

  a. License grant.

       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
               in part; and

            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
          its terms and conditions.

       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
          6(a).

       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
          (4) never produces Adapted Material.

       5. Downstream recipients.

            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
               Public License.

            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
               Material.

       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

  b. Other rights.

       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
          Rights, but not otherwise.

       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
          Public License.

       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
          reserves any right to collect such royalties.


Section 3 -- License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
following conditions.

  a. Attribution.

       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
          form), You must:

            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
               with the Licensed Material:

                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                    Material and any others designated to receive
                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                    designated);

                ii. a copyright notice;

               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                    warranties;

                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                    extent reasonably practicable;

            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and

            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
               hyperlink to, this Public License.

       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
          information.

       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
          reasonably practicable.

       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
          Material from complying with this Public License.


Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
     portion of the contents of the database;

  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and

  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.


Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
     waiver of all liability.


Section 6 -- Term and Termination.

  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
     terminate automatically.

  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
     Section 6(a), it reinstates:

       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
          violation; or

       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
     of this Public License.

  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
     will not terminate this Public License.

  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
     License.


Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.

  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.


Section 8 -- Interpretation.

  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
     be made without permission under this Public License.

  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
     conditions.

  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
     Licensor.

  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.
