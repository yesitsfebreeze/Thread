# Introduction

**Thread** is a free form role-play system, for 2-6 players, that allows you to create immersive stories which are either led completely by the players, or are structured by a guide.

## What you need to play
- **Dice**: Each player needs up to **6** six-sided dice (D6).
- **Character Sheet**: [Downloadable here](https://melkot.com/char-sheet.gif).
- A unique physical object for the **Seal** token (e.g., a coin, stone, or figurine).
- **Imagination**: For collaborative storytelling and world-building.

---
# Pillars

Before the story begins, the party defines its **pillars** — the shared vibe, direction, and boundaries of play.  

Write them down before diving into play, preferably on a single sheet of paper.  
Pillars should be agreed on together — they are not plot hooks, but a contract that frames the story.  

Each player may set up to **3 Positive** and **3 Negative** Pillars.

## Positive
Things you want to experience.
- I like Romance
- Magic is real
- We should feel epic

## Negative
Things you do not want.
- No Blood and Violence
- Let’s not leave the City.
- No over the top comedy

---
# Seal

This is a token, which represents both a **safety** and a **story** tool. It ensures the party can choose when threats should be allowed and reminds everyone at the table to keep the story tight.

One player begins the game with the token, it can be any unique object you have around.  
The token may only be used **once** per scene.

## Exploration

If the holder places it in the **center of the table**, no new [[#Threats|threats]] may be declared. Narration continues freely, focusing on character and story instead of conflict.
Any player may take it from the center if they feel the party is ready for threats again.  

## Coherence

It may also be passed **directly** from one player to another as a gentle signal,
*“Can we stay closer to the story?”*
This is never a punishment. It is a nudge to keep tone, focus, and pacing in harmony. 

If whoever feels like the current owner is misusing the Seal, The party can decide to give it to a new player.
If there is a dispute or something is unclear, the person with the Seal decides, then give it to the one who was overruled.

# Characters

Your character is the lens through which you experience this world.
In this game, both, characters and encounters are functionally the same. They only differ due to encounters having story relevant information.

Characters and encounters consist of:
- A name
- A description (and an image/mini if you like)
- Composure - how much stress you can endure *(default max 12)* 
- 3 Stats ([[#Stats|Fitness]], [[#Stats|Reason]], [[#Stats|Instinct]])
- Several Artifacts *(default max 6)*
- Critical Sequence

---
# Critical Sequence

When you create a new character, roll **2D6**.  
The result becomes your **Critical Sequence** — two special numbers unique to your character.  

Whenever you roll dice during play:  
- If one of your dice matches a number from your **Critical Sequence**, that die counts as a **guaranteed success**.  
- The same applies to your opposition — every character and encounter has their own **Critical Sequence**.  

### Double Criticals
If both sides roll a critical success in the same conflict, the **challenged player** wins the resolution.  

### Example
- Alice’s Critical Sequence is **4** and **6**.  
- She rolls 3 dice during a conflict and gets **2, 4, 6**.  
- Because she rolled a **4 AND 6**, she triggers a **guaranteed success**, no matter the opposition’s total.  

---
# Stats

Each [[#Characters|character]] and [[#Encounters|encounter]] has a stat-block.
They define how many dice you can use in a roll.

The Stats consist of:
- **Fitness** (FIT)
  - If the obstacle would yield to muscle, stamina, or raw coordination
- **Reason** (RES)
  - If thinking, noticing, or planning beats brawn or force of will
- **Instinct** (INS)
  - If the scene needs persuasion or manipulation

When creating a [[#Characters|character]], spend **3** points however you like.
The distribution will inform how you role-play your character.

> Example: FIT 3, RES 0, INS 0, makes you strong... but not very bright.

---
# Stress

**Stress** measures how much strain your character can endure before they collapse. It represents physical exhaustion, mental pressure, and emotional weight all at once.

Each character begins with a **Composure of 3**.
Whenever you **lose a conflict**, you gain Stress equal to the declared Threat Level. Some **Artifacts** may also require you to take Stress in order to use them.

If your Stress reaches your **Composure**, your character **collapses**.

---
# Collapse

When your **Stress** reaches your current **Composure**, your character collapses. This doesn’t mean they are gone forever, but it does mean they can be an active part of role-play, for now.
At this moment, your character becomes an **Encounter** — part of the world rather than a player’s protagonist.

Once the encounter you became is resolved or leaves the story, you return as your character. When you awaken, increase your **Composure by +1** up to a maximum of **12**.

---
# Encounters

Encounters are the living pulse of the world — rivals, allies, strangers, or even forces of nature. They exist to challenge the party, reveal secrets, and drive the story forward.

While mechanically they function just like [[#Characters|characters]], an encounter always has two additional things:

- *A Goal* — what they want to achieve, protect, or prevent.
- *Information* — a truth, clue, or piece of knowledge they carry that becomes clear when their goal slips away.

When an encounter **fails to achieve its goal** or is **defeated in a roll**, it reveals the **information it holds**. This might be a secret, a map, a weakness, or even a hint about greater threats.

Unlike characters, encounters **lose [[#Stress|stress]]** instead of gaining it when they fail. If their stress is reduced to **0**, the encounter disappears from the story. Before they fade, they drop one of their [[#Artifacts|artifacts]], which other players may claim. If that player already carries their maximum of artifacts, they must discard one to pick it up.

### Encounter Scaling
When setting an encounter’s difficulty, choose one of these approaches:

- **Lowest Party Composure** → Encounters are easier; best for lighter, story-focused play. *(default)*
- **Highest Party Composure** → Encounters are tougher; best for groups that want more challenge.
- **Current Player’s Composure** → Difficulty shifts dynamically depending on who is facing the  threat; best for experienced groups that enjoy unpredictability.

---
# Artifacts

**Artifacts** are strange phenomenon of power. No one fully understands them — they are discovered through play and carried by inhabitants of the world.

An Artifact always has a **dominant stat**. This is the stat it resonates with most strongly. When a character uses an Artifact:

- If the character’s value in the dominant stat is **equal to or higher than the Artifact’s requirement**, they may roll the listed number of bonus dice without cost.	

- If the character’s value is **lower**, they can still use it, but must take **Stress equal to the difference** between their stat and the Artifact’s requirement.
	Characters Body Stat = +2
	Artifact Requirement = Body +3
	Player needs to take *1* [[#Stress]] to use it. 

This means any character can attempt to wield any Artifact, but not without risk. The further away it is from their nature, the more it strains them.

Artifacts are powerful, but they are also burdens. A character can only carry as many Artifacts as their **Composure** to a maximum of **6**.
- At Composure 1, you may carry 1 Artifact.
- At Composure 2, you may carry 2 Artifacts.
- And so on... until 6.

If you gain a new Artifact while already at your maximum, you must discard or trade one you hold.

Artifacts are not just tools — they are also story seeds. Their origins, side-effects, and true purposes can be explored as the parties wishes. They may help, they may harm... but often they do both.

# Threats

This game can be played in several modes. It depends on the fact if you have an adventure prepared, or if you want to play in a free form improvisation mode.

## Exploratory

In exploratory style, each [[#Characters|character]] can oppose another and demand a [[#Resolving Conflicts|roll]]. The opposition may propose one or multiple stats that apply, and a [[#Threat Levels|Threat Level]]. If the table finds the threat to harsh or generally unjustified, the [[#Seal|seal]] might be used.

## Guided

If any one person has a specific story or adventure in mind, they can choose to become the guide. 
The guide can demand [[#Resolving Conflicts|rolls]] if a player does something risky and guide the players through the story. Keeping them on track.

---
# Resolving Conflicts

Whenever you are threatened by an [[#Encounters|encounter]] or another [[#Characters|character]], you will need to roll dice to determine the result. 
Before a roll, the opposing player or guide declares a threat whenever the outcome seems uncertain. The threat needs to be made in one of the stats category ([[#Stats|FIT]], [[#Stats|RES]], [[#Stats|INS]]), and have one of the *3* levels listed below. The table can veto if the level feels unjustified, using the [[#Seal]] if needed.

All rolls use **1D6** at minimum. 

### Levels
- **Minor** +1D6 - *small stakes, low risk*  
- **Risky** +2D6 - *significant stakes*  
- **Fatal** +3D6 - *high stakes, dramatic events*  

When narration is opposed, resolve it with a **roll**.Each side gathers dice from [[#Stats]], [[#Artifacts]], and the declared [[#Levels|Level]].
The **highest sum** of the roll decides the winner.
### As the challenged player
- add the amount of **D6** for the challenged stat ([[#Stats|FIT]], [[#Stats|RES]], [[#Stats|INS]])
- When using an Artifact, add **D6** based on its description and pay its cost.
### As the threatening player
- Add the amount of **D6** based on the [[#Levels|Level]]
### As an encounter
- add the amount of **D6** for the challenged stat ([[#Stats|FIT]], [[#Stats|RES]], [[#Stats|INS]])
- Add the amount of **D6** based on the [[#Levels|Level]]

## Resolution
### **Winner**
Narrates the outcome.
### **Loser**:
Characters gain [[#Stress]] equal to the [[#Levels| Level]]:
Encounters lose [[#Stress]] equal to the [[#Levels|Level]]:
- Minor → 1 Stress
- Risky → 2 Stress
- Fatal → 3 Stress

**Ties** are in favor of the challenged player.

# Party Wipes

When each member of the party is an [[#Encounters|encounter]], the party is considered wiped.

You can choose to continue playing as your current encounters/NPCS, that just means you will take over the **Stats**, **Name** and **Description** of the encounter.

# Improvisation Tools  

Improvisation is the heart of collaborative storytelling. These simple techniques help keep the story flowing, build on each other’s ideas, and avoid stalls at the table.  

| Yes, and | No, and |
| -------- | ------- |
| Yes, but | No, but |

### **Yes, And…**  
- Accept what another player has said as true (*Yes…*) and then add to it (*…and…*).  
- Example:  
  - **Player A**: “The library is locked.”  
  - **Player B**: “Yes, and the old caretaker left a key hidden under a loose brick.”  

This keeps momentum going instead of shutting things down.  

### **Yes, But…**  
- Accept what was said, but introduce a twist or complication.  
- Example:  
  - **Player A**: “The door swings open.”  
  - **Player B**: “Yes, but it creaks so loudly that everyone nearby hears it.”  

This adds drama while still moving the story forward.  

### **No, And…**  
- Reject the suggestion *and* escalate the situation by adding a new obstacle or complication.  
- Example:  
  - **Player A**: “I cut the rope before the guard notices.”  
  - **Player B**: “No, and the rope snaps back, knocking over a lantern that sets the curtains on fire.”  

This is the harshest option — use it sparingly — but it can heighten tension and push the story into unexpected directions.  

### **No, But…**  
- Reject the direct suggestion, but offer an alternative that still gives the other player something.  
- Example:  
  - **Player A**: “I find gold coins in the chest.”  
  - **Player B**: “No, but you do find a strange artifact with markings you don’t understand.”  

This prevents dead ends while still steering the story.  

### **Ask Questions**  
If you’re stuck, turn the spotlight back:  
- “What do you see?”  
- “How does your character feel about this?”  

Questions keep everyone invested and share the creative load across the table.  

### **Build on Pillars**  
When improvising, return to the agreed **Positive** and **Negative Pillars**. They’re a compass:  
- **Positive Pillar** → lean into it when you want to heighten drama or add color.  
- **Negative Pillar** → use it as a boundary to stay in tone and avoid derailing play.  


### **Use the Seal**  
The Seal isn’t just safety — it’s also a pacing tool.  
- If the table is drifting or stalling, pass the Seal as a gentle way to signal: *“Let’s pull this back to focus.”*  


**Tip**: These tools aren’t rules you must follow every time. Think of them as tricks in your pocket — when you’re unsure what to do, pick one and the story will keep flowing.  


# Hidden Meta Layer
THIS INFO IS NOT VISIBLE TO THE PLAYER BEFORE THE FIRST PLAYTHROUGH

The hidden meta layer of this system is, that at the end of one character *(reached his max composure level)*, the player can choose to upload his current character and one known item/entity/ability that they created during play into an online vault.
This vault is then used to feed new character creation and drives the random encounters.
The character sheet and encounter selection will happen through a web app.
This layer is only unlocked when you played through the game once.
