The idea is to portrait sick people as normal human beings. And the ones that have no issues (doesnt really exist) as the sick. So they discover over time that this package is a device to either make themselves sick with the spores, or make everyone healthy.

In Droskow, those touched by the Dreg—seemingly "sick"—are the ones living fully as human beings, their quirks and adaptations making them resilient and strangely vibrant. Meanwhile, those who appear "healthy," clinging to a fading ideal of normalcy, are the ones truly diminished, their resistance to the Dreg rendering them hollow or obsessive. The package, marked for 17 Ashen Row, becomes the campaign’s crux—a device that could either spread the Dreg’s transformative spores to the players, embracing their humanity through "sickness," or purge the Dreg from Droskow, restoring a sterile "health" that might strip the city of its vitality. The players’ journey reveals that sickness is not a flaw but a facet of existence, while the pursuit of perfection is the real affliction.
