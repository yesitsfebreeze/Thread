Little is remembered of the river upon which [[Droskow]] was founded. Once, it must have been a lifeline: broad, swift, and full of fish. Now it is a husk of its former self, a patchwork of stagnant pools and trickling threads of dark water. The air carries the sour weight of wet earth and decay, a constant reminder of what the city could have become.
