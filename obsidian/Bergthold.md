Hes the owner and bartender of the [[Berg Inn]]. Concentric, slightly off beat and has a weird stutter that almost feels like he looses grip to reality sometimes. He doesn't want to tell you anything, unless you buy him a drink.

Hes a secret spore-dealer that shares some info about how he applies spores to an object to shape it to his liking.
