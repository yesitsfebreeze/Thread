# Memorycrawling: Stories That Collapse Inward  

Most RPG structures are about **outward exploration**. You hexcrawl into wilderness, dungeon-crawl into stone tunnels, sandbox your way across an open world. The loop is expansion.  

But what if the crawl didn’t go outwards, but **inwards**?  

That’s the idea behind **Memorycrawling** — a structure where players don’t chart maps, but uncover buried memories, lost agendas, and fragments of their own making.

## How Memorycrawling Works  

- **Tokens as the Clock**  
  Each character carries a visible track of “tokens.” Failures and risks push it higher. When it fills, collapse triggers.  

- **Collapse as the Engine**  
  Collapse isn’t punishment. It’s progress. Each collapse pushes the story inward:  
  - A new **encounter** erupts into the world, altering the city.  
  - A fragment of the group’s lost **agenda** surfaces. The players begin to remember why they are here.  
  - A goal to create a new story fragment, how epic it might be.  

- **Fragments as Legacy**  
  Every campaign ends not with a “boss fight” but with a fragment, uploaded to a shared vault for future groups to start with. The world becomes denser and stranger over time.

## What Makes It Different  

- **Westmarches Turned Inward**  
  Traditional Westmarches play is outward — hexes revealed, maps filled, factions uncovered. Memorycrawling keeps the modular, persistent structure, but replaces geography with memory and collapse.  

- **No GM, No Map**  
  Infection tokens, collapse triggers, and encounter tables drive the game. Players set their own pace by choosing easy/medium/hard risks. The world pushes back automatically.  

- **Emergent Narrative**  
  Encounters, agendas, and artifacts are oracular. Their order is unpredictable, but their escalation is inevitable. Each campaign tells a different story, but every story spirals down the same funnel: collapse, memory, artifact.

## Why Memorycrawling Matters  

It solves a common problem: too many RPGs need a GM to push the story forward. In Memorycrawling, the **system itself is the storyteller**. The players only decide *how hard to push*.  

The result is an RPG loop that is:  
- **Visible** (infection tokens on the table).  
- **Inevitable** (collapse always comes).  
- **Persistent** (artifacts survive for the next group).  
- **Emergent** (the crawl order is unique every time).

## Closing Thought  

Where dungeon-crawls dig through stone, memorycrawls dig through *people*.  
Where hexcrawls chart land, memorycrawls chart *why you are here at all*.  

You don’t crawl out into the unknown.  
You collapse in, again and again, until what was forgotten finally takes shape.
