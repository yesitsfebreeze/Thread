# Thread RPG (Condensed)

## What You Need
- **Dice**: up to 6d6 per player  
- **Character sheet**  
- **The Seal**: any token  
- **Imagination**  

---

## Pillars
Before play, agree on up to 3 **Positive** and 3 **Negative** Pillars to set tone and limits. Write them down.

---

## The Seal
- **Exploration**: Place Seal in center → no new Threats until taken back.  
- **Coherence**: Pass Seal to refocus tone/pacing.  
- The Seal decides disputes. One use per scene.  

---

## Characters
Each has:  
- Name + description  
- **Composure** (stress cap, starts at 3, max 12)  
- **Stats**: 3 points split across Fitness (FIT), Reason (RES), Instinct (INS)  
- **Critical Sequence**: 2 numbers (2d6 roll at creation)  
- Up to 6 **Artifacts**  

### Criticals
If you roll your Critical number → automatic success.  
Both sides crit? Challenged player wins.  

---

## Stress & Collapse
- Lose a roll → gain Stress equal to Threat Level.  
- At Composure → collapse. You become an Encounter until its story ends.  
- Return with +1 Composure (max 12).  

---

## Encounters
Like characters, but also:  
- A **Goal** and **Information**.  
- Lose Stress when defeated. At 0 → vanish and drop an Artifact.  

Difficulty = lowest, highest, or acting player’s Composure (group choice).  

---

## Artifacts
Grant bonus dice in a stat.  
- If your stat ≥ requirement → free.  
- If lower → pay Stress = difference.  
Max carried = Composure (up to 6).  

---

## Threats
Two modes:  
- **Exploratory**: Players may oppose each other, proposing Stat + Level.  
- **Guided**: GM calls Threats to steer story.  

### Levels
- **Minor**: +1d6 (1 Stress)  
- **Risky**: +2d6 (2 Stress)  
- **Fatal**: +3d6 (3 Stress)  

---

## Conflict Resolution
1. **Challenged Player**: Roll stat + artifacts.  
2. **Threatening Side**: Roll Level dice (+ stat if Encounter).  
3. Add dice, highest total wins.  
   - Ties → challenged player wins.  
   - Loser: characters gain Stress, encounters lose Stress.  
4. Winner narrates outcome.  

---

## Party Wipes
If everyone collapses → you may continue as your Encounters/NPCs.  

---

## Improvisation Tools (Quick Ref)
- **Yes, And / Yes, But / No, But / No, And** → build momentum.  
- **Ask Questions** to keep spotlight moving.  
- **Return to Pillars** for tone.  
- **Use the Seal** to refocus pacing.
