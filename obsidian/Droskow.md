**Droskow** began as a humble fishing hamlet on the marsh, blessed with waters so rich that nets could be lowered from windows and hauled up heavy with silver-scaled bounty. Its position between two great kingdoms made it a natural harbor, where goods from the mainland gathered before venturing to the wider sea. From those waters the hamlet grew into a town, and the town into a city.

Now, the river has dwindled to mud and puddles. Everything in Droskow is clammy and dry at once. The [[Canals]], once crowded with barges and cargo, lie as sticky trenches of drifting sludge. From these puddles the first breath of the [[Dreg]] escaped. A bubble swelled in the heart of the city — larger than any before — and after a long, uneasy week, it burst. Life changed, and so did the city. Trade is dead, but somehow, no one starves. The land is stingy, the fish are gone, yet bowls stay full. People don’t ask why. Best not to.
